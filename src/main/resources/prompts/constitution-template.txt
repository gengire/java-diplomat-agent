# Our Communication Constitution

*A living agreement for how we talk to each other, especially when things get hard.*

---

## 🤝 Core Principles

1. **Assume Good Intent** — We believe the other person is trying, even when it doesn't feel like it.
2. **Speak for Ourselves** — We use "I feel..." and "I need..." statements instead of "You always..." and "You never..."
3. **Listen to Understand** — We listen to truly hear, not just to prepare our response.
4. **One Topic at a Time** — We address one issue before moving to the next.
5. **Respect Over Winning** — The goal is understanding, not being "right."

## 📏 Ground Rules

- **No name-calling or personal attacks** — We address the behavior, not the character.
- **No past-dredging** — If it's been resolved, it stays resolved. We don't re-open old wounds as ammunition.
- **No scorekeeping** — We don't tally up who did what to prove a point.
- **No silent treatment** — If we need space, we say so explicitly and commit to a time to return.
- **No interrupting** — We let the other person finish their thought.

## ⏸️ The Timeout Rule

- **Either person can call a timeout at any time, no questions asked.**
- A timeout lasts 10 minutes (adjust as needed: _____).
- During timeout, we do something calming — not stewing.
- We return to the conversation after the timeout.
- The person who called the timeout speaks first when we reconvene.

## 🔄 The Rewind Rule

- Either person can ask for a "rewind" — a chance to rephrase something that came out wrong.
- When someone asks for a rewind, the other person grants it without judgment.
- Example: "Can I rewind? What I meant to say was..."

## 🌡️ Temperature Check

- We'll check in with how we're feeling during the conversation.
- Scale of 1-10: 1 = calm and good, 10 = about to boil over.
- If either person hits 7+, we take a timeout.

## ✅ After a Difficult Conversation

- We acknowledge the effort: "Thank you for talking through this with me."
- We identify one thing the other person did well.
- We note if anything is unresolved and schedule a time to revisit.
